## High-Level Design

The high-level design section includes an overview of the system architecture, major components, and their interactions.

- **Architecture Diagrams**: High-level diagrams showing the overall system structure.
- **Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of system components and their responsibilities.

## Low-Level Design

The low-level design section provides detailed information about the individual components and their interactions.

- **Class Diagrams**: UML diagrams showing the classes and their relationships.
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Diagrams depicting the interactions between actors and the system.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Diagrams showing how objects interact in a particular scenario.

## Detailed Design

The detailed design section focuses on implementation details, data models, and interfaces.

- **API Specifications**: Detailed documentation of APIs, including endpoints, request/response structures, and examples.
- **ER Diagrams**: Entity-relationship diagrams showing the database structure.

## Documentation

This section contains detailed documentation for each design phase.
